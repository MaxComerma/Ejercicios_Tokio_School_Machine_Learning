Tokio School Exercises â€“ Machine Learning
Repository with practical exercises from a Machine Learning course. Includes topics such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, as well as the development of ML systems, from fundamentals to more advanced applications.

Note: All content is in Spanish, but some of the more complex and interesting exercises are in English (one folder containing all the English exercises still needs to be updated).
